    <div class=styleone> Interests:
    <ul>
       <li>Video games - Current large time-waster of mine is Final Fantsy XIV. It would be also be cool to work on making one some day!</li>
       <li>Gym - I do my best to stay dedicated to it!</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>I am majoring in Computer Science and have selected it because it had seemed interesting to me. Once I got to actually programming, I found it very rewarding when figuring out how to make things work with coding.</p>
    
    <p>Aside from lounging around and playing video games all day, if resources were not an issue I'd love to spend my time working on making new apps or even video games with my brothers.</p>
