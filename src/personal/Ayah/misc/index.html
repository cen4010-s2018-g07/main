        <h1>Ayah Elshaikh</h1>
        <p>My name is Ayah Elshaikh and I'm currently in my third year of college. I'm dual-majoring in Computer Science and Computer Engineering, and have really enjoyed my college career thus far. I'm always being challenged, which allows me to expand my knowledge on a daily basis. I'm experienced in programming in C, C++, Assembly, and HTML. Although I love dealing with software, I prefer working with hardware. </p>
